# The-Modding-Tree

A modified version of The Prestige Tree that is much easier to mod. It still requires programming knowledge, but it's mostly pretty easy things and copy/pasting.

[Look here for a tutorial on getting started with modding with TMT](docs/getting-started.md)

You can look in the [documentation](docs/!general-info.md) for more information on how it all works, or look at the code in layers.js to see what it all looks like.
IEmory, I'm not telling you to change anything,  I'm just telling you that i want you to continue working on your tree quest, it is one of my favorite prestige tree mods
